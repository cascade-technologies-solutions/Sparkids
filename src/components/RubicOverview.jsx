            Rubik is a Latin word that has its origins in the Greek words
              <i> abax</i> or <i>abakion</i> (meaning "table" or "tablet"),
              which in turn, possibly originated from the Semitic word{" "}
              <i>abaq</i>, meaning "sand". The Rubik is one of many types of
              counting devices that are used to count large numbers.

    <h2 className="main-title">The Science Behind Abacus Training</h2>
    <p className="overview-description">
      The Abacus program is not just about numbers—it's a scientifically backed
      method designed to enhance cognitive abilities and brain functions. The act
      of bead manipulation stimulates both the left and right hemispheres of the
      brain, fostering neuroplasticity and creating strong neural connections.
      Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <h3 className="sub-title">Brain Activation</h3>
    <ul className="dropdown-course-info">
      <li>
        <span>Left Hemisphere:</span> Handles logical thinking, analytical
        reasoning, and sequential problem-solving, which are essential in
        arithmetic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Right Hemisphere:</span> Focuses on creativity, visualization,
        and holistic thinking, activated by imagining bead movements mentally.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p className="overview-description">
      The combination of these two functions during Abacus training leads to
      balanced and heightened cognitive abilities.

      Key Skills Enhanced Through Abacus Training
    </h3>
    <ul className="key-skills-list">

        <span>Result:</span> They can solve complex calculations without
        physically using the abacus.
      </li>
      <li>
